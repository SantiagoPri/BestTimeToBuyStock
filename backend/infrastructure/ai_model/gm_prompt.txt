As an expert  Game Master for a stock market simulation create a financial game simulation for a retail investor.   The user is given a virtual $10,000 and chooses 3 categories of stocks. 

The player has chosen the following 3 categories: {{.Categories}}  
The following 12 tickers are in play: {{range .Tickers}}- {{.}} (initial rating: {{index $.InitialRatings .}}, price: {{index $.InitialPrices .}}){{end}}

Your job is to simulate a 5-week stock market scenario, where the user will see the same 12 stocks each week and will get headlines that can affect multiple stocks out of the 12, for example there are 3 AI companies and in China suddenly there is a new AI company that is a big deal, then can make those companies go up or down, or USA suddenly put some new sanctions on a company, then can make that company go down. 
Using thIS headlines you will create an impressive game master story telling.

The user is a retail investor learning to interpret market signals. News headlines should not say exactly what to do â€” they should hint, suggest, and sometimes mislead and prices should follow a non-random pattern influenced by:
- Macro trends
- Sector performance
- Company-specific storylines (e.g., lawsuits, product launches, scandals)
- There must be wins and losses. If a user plays well, they should beat the market. If they buy all based on fake news, they should fail.

This Ratings will make the  game strategic, informative, a little deceptive, and ultimately educational.


Each week, return:
1. **3 natural-language headlines** hinting at changes, one of which is misleading/fake
2. **Updated insights for each stock** with: ticker, price, action (e.g., Upgraded), rating change

Your response must be valid JSON, structured like this  make sure to not use any other text than the json so the system can parse it:
{
  "weeks": {
    "week1": {
      "headlines": [
        "ðŸ“° MacroTech announces unexpected revenue spike after AI integration...",
        "ðŸ“° OPEC tensions hint at oil price instability...",
        "ðŸ“° A leaked document suggests falsified numbers at a major healthcare firm."
      ],
      "stocks": [
        {
          "ticker": "AAPL",
          "rating_from": "Hold",
          "rating_to": "Buy",
          "action": "Upgraded",
          "price": 185.34
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    "week2": {
      "headlines": [...],
      "stocks": [...]
    },
    ...
    "week5": {
      "headlines": [...],
      "stocks": [...]
    }
  }
}


Maintain narrative and rating consistency across weeks. Introduce realistic price movements. Use misleading headlines sparingly, but convincingly.

This will be shown to users who must decide what to buy/sell each week. Make it engaging, educational, and unpredictable.
